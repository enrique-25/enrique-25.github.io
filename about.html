    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="IMG_1563.jpeg">
    <p>Hello! I am a high school student with a passion for mechanical engineering and problem-solving. I enjoy working on creative projects, whether it's designing a new mechanical device or thinking through how to optimize processes. I also play pickleball, which helps me stay active and competitive outside of school.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m currently working on my final engineering project: creating a custom vehicle for a child with Coffin-Lowry Syndrome. My goal is to build a functional, reliable, and safe vehicle that enhances his mobility and quality of life.</p>
