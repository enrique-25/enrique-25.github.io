        <p>Hi I am Enrique Groso, a high school student with a passion for engineering and a love for hands-on problem-solving. Currently, I’m working on an exciting project designing a device to measure wrist pressure while writing, aiming to improve ergonomics and prevent strain. I’m always eager to explore new subjects, whether it's diving into economics, literature, or analyzing films through archetypes. Learning and creativity drive my work, and I’m constantly seeking new ways to apply what I’ve learned in practical, meaningful ways.

            Outside of academics, I have a strong passion for pickleball. It’s not just a fun way to stay active but also a sport that sharpens my focus and quick thinking. Playing regularly helps me balance my studies and personal projects, and it's a great way to stay connected with my community.</p>
