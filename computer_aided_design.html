            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/Sketch 1.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 1">
                <p>Sketch 1: This image showcases an initial top-view sketch of a steering wheel design in Fusion 360. The sketch features a circular outline with radial lines connecting the center to the outer rim, along with several circular holes for fasteners or design elements, indicating the start of the design process for creating a functional component.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Image 2 -->
            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/Sketch 2.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 2">
                <p>Sketch 2: This image represents the next step in the steering wheel design, where a central hub has been extruded from the initial sketch. The added cylindrical body in the center of the steering wheel indicates progress toward the 3D modeling stage, showing the evolution from flat sketch to more dimensional features.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Image 3 -->
            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/Sketch 3.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 3">
                <p>Sketch 3: This image shows a partially completed top-view CAD design of a steering wheel. The focus is on the skeleton structure of the steering wheel, consisting of three arms radiating from a central hub. These arms feature multiple circular cutouts, likely for weight reduction or to accommodate fasteners. The outline of the steering wheel's outer rim is visible as a transparent circular boundary, indicating where the grip will eventually attach. The image showcases an early stage of 3D modeling, with attention on the functional skeletal structure.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Image 4 -->
            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/Sketch 4.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 4">
                <p>Sketch 4: This image builds on the earlier stage, now featuring a 3D-extruded rim around the perimeter of the steering wheel, giving it a more complete appearance. The outer grip, which is a key ergonomic feature of the steering wheel, is now included as a raised circular shape, complementing the central skeletal structure. The arms with circular holes are visible underneath the transparent grip, and the design has advanced closer to the final product.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Image 5 -->
            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/Sketch 5.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 5">
                <p>Sketch 5: In this image, the steering wheel design is further refined. The central hub and arm structure remain similar, but the grip appears more solid and integrated. The arms maintain their minimalist design with circular cutouts, which may serve both aesthetic and structural purposes. This image likely represents a later stage in the design process, with a nearly complete 3D model of the steering wheel. The transparent effects and clear separation of components provide a well-defined view of the assembled model.</p>

            <!-- Image 6 -->
            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/CAD 1.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 6">
                <p>CAD 1: This image showcases a vibrant, stylized unicorn head design in vector format within a graphic design software interface. The unicorn's head is primarily pink with a neon color scheme, featuring a rainbow mane and horn. The mane includes shades of green, blue, yellow, and purple. The unicorn's expression is bold, with sharp eyes and defined contours. The software's toolbar and color wheel are visible on the screen, indicating that the design is being edited or adjusted.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Image 7 -->
            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/CAD 2.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 7">
                <p>CAD 2: This image displays a minimalistic wireframe outline of the same unicorn head design. The image appears to be a vector path, showing the outlines without any fill or color. The fine lines trace the overall shape of the unicorn's head, mane, and horn. The outlines are simplified and in the early stages of development, suggesting that this is a foundational part of the design process.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Image 8 -->
            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/CAD 3.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 8">
                <p>CAD 3: This image shows a partially completed version of the unicorn head design, now with solid color fills. Each section of the unicorn, including the mane, face, and horn, is filled with different bold colors. The pink outline from the previous image is retained, while the inner areas are filled with flat, bright hues such as green, red, purple, and blue. The layers and color palette are visible on the side of the graphic design software, indicating that this is still a work in progress.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Image 9 -->
            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/CAD 4.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 9">
                <p>CAD 4: This image shows a variety of colorful vinyl stickers arranged on a white surface, likely a laptop or notebook. The stickers are in different colors, featuring shapes that resemble a unicorn's head in multiple designs. The colors range from green, blue, pink, red, and yellow. There is a small pair of scissors placed beside the stickers, suggesting the stickers are part of a crafting project.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Image 10 -->
            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/CAD 5.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 10">
                <p>CAD 5: This image highlights a single unicorn sticker. The unicorn head is composed of different colored sections—pink for the main body, green, red, and blue for the mane, with a golden horn. The sticker design shows multiple layers, each in a bold, vibrant color, creating a striking contrast.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Image 11 -->
            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/CAD 6.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 11">
                <p>CAD 6: This image features a wooden cutout in the shape of a unicorn’s head. The wood appears to have been laser cut or etched, with the burn marks clearly visible around the edges. The unicorn’s mane and horn are intricately detailed, creating a clean outline. The natural wood grain and burn give it an earthy and rustic appearance.</p>
