                <img src="images/CAD 1.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 6">
                <p>CAD 1: This image showcases a vibrant, stylized unicorn head design in vector format within a graphic design software interface. The unicorn's head is primarily pink with a neon color scheme, featuring a rainbow mane and horn. The mane includes shades of green, blue, yellow, and purple. The unicorn's expression is bold, with sharp eyes and defined contours. The software's toolbar and color wheel are visible on the screen, indicating that the design is being edited or adjusted.</p>
            </div>

                <img src="images/CAD 2.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 7">
                <p>CAD 2: This image displays a minimalistic wireframe outline of the same unicorn head design. The image appears to be a vector path, showing the outlines without any fill or color. The fine lines trace the overall shape of the unicorn's head, mane, and horn. The outlines are simplified and in the early stages of development, suggesting that this is a foundational part of the design process.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/CAD 3.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 8">
                <p>CAD 3: This image shows a partially completed version of the unicorn head design, now with solid color fills. Each section of the unicorn, including the mane, face, and horn, is filled with different bold colors. The pink outline from the previous image is retained, while the inner areas are filled with flat, bright hues such as green, red, purple, and blue. The layers and color palette are visible on the side of the graphic design software, indicating that this is still a work in progress.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Image 9 -->
            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/CAD 4.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 9">
                <p>CAD 4: This image shows a variety of colorful vinyl stickers arranged on a white surface, likely a laptop or notebook. The stickers are in different colors, featuring shapes that resemble a unicorn's head in multiple designs. The colors range from green, blue, pink, red, and yellow. There is a small pair of scissors placed beside the stickers, suggesting the stickers are part of a crafting project.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/CAD 5.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 10">
                <p>CAD 5: This image highlights a single unicorn sticker. The unicorn head is composed of different colored sections—pink for the main body, green, red, and blue for the mane, with a golden horn. The sticker design shows multiple layers, each in a bold, vibrant color, creating a striking contrast.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Image 11 -->
            <div class="image-item">
                <img src="images/CAD 6.png" alt="Description of CAD Project 11">
                <p>CAD 6: This image features a wooden cutout in the shape of a unicorn’s head. The wood appears to have been laser cut or etched, with the burn marks clearly visible around the edges. The unicorn’s mane and horn are intricately detailed, creating a clean outline. The natural wood grain and burn give it an earthy and rustic appearance.</p>
