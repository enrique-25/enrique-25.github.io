                <p>Ki 1: This image shows the schematic design of a simple LED circuit in KiCad's Schematic Editor. The circuit consists of a battery cell labeled "BT1," a resistor labeled "R1," and an LED labeled "D1." The components are connected in series, with the positive terminal of the battery connected to the resistor, which is then connected to the anode of the LED. The cathode of the LED completes the circuit back to the negative terminal of the battery.</p>

                <p>Ki 2: This image displays the PCB layout for the LED circuit in KiCad's PCB Editor. The components (battery, resistor, and LED) are arranged within the board outline. A circular outline indicates the battery holder, and the connections between components are shown with red and green tracks representing the positive and negative traces. The layout also includes labels for each component and the text "Amazing Circuit" on the board.</p>

                <p>Ki 3: This image shows a 3D render of the PCB, giving a realistic preview of the assembled board. The battery holder, resistor, and LED are visible on the green PCB, which has a square shape. The components are positioned according to the layout, with the resistor and LED placed on the board's surface. The view provides a perspective of the circuit as it would appear in a physical form after manufacturing.</p>
