      <h2>Final Project</h2>
      <p>For my final engineering project, I am developing a custom vehicle tailored for Jorge, who faces challenges with Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS). This project aims to address his specific needs by creating a vehicle with features such as reliable remote control, nocturnal lighting, and enhanced suspension for rough terrains.</p>
      
      <h3>Problem Validation</h3>
      <p>The validation of the problem comes from the contributions of two key individuals who have provided unique insights into the project:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jorge's Father:</strong> With extensive experience caring for a son with Coffin-Lowry Syndrome, Jorge's father has dedicated significant effort to adjusting his life to meet his son’s unique needs. His deep understanding of the condition, combined with firsthand experience managing the daily challenges it presents, offers invaluable guidance for designing a vehicle that accommodates Jorge's mobility, communication, and focus challenges. His input ensures the design prioritizes practicality and real-world usability.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Matt Armstrong:</strong> An accomplished automotive YouTuber with a passion for building and modifying vehicles, Matt brings extensive experience in vehicle customization. While his primary focus is on racing, his expertise in high-performance engineering, combined with a meticulous approach to customization, will guide the development of this specialized vehicle. Matt’s knowledge of durable mechanics and effective design will help ensure that the vehicle is capable of handling rough terrains while remaining accessible and easy to control for Jorge.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The combined insights from Jorge’s father and Matt Armstrong ensure the project is well-grounded in both the specific needs of individuals with Coffin-Lowry Syndrome and expert automotive engineering.</p>
