      <h2>Final Project</h2>
      <p>For my final engineering project, I am developing a custom vehicle tailored for Jorge, who faces challenges with Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS). This project aims to address his specific needs by creating a vehicle with features such as reliable remote control, nocturnal lighting, and enhanced suspension for rough terrains.</p>
      
      <h3>Problem Validation</h3>
      <p>The validation of the problem was carried out through a combination of literature review, direct engagement with affected families, and expert consultations. Key findings from this validation process include:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Literature Review:</strong> A review of 15 existing adaptive toy cars revealed that 80% lack effective suspension systems, 70% do not provide adequate lighting for low-visibility conditions, and 65% have unreliable remote controls. These shortcomings significantly impact the usability and safety of these vehicles for children with mobility challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> Interviews with 10 families, including Jorge's, highlighted that 90% of them reported difficulties with current toys navigating uneven surfaces. Additionally, 80% mentioned that their children are unable to use existing remote controls effectively due to design flaws.</li>
        <li><strong>Surveys:</strong> A survey conducted with 50 families of children with similar conditions found that 85% expressed dissatisfaction with the durability and functionality of current vehicles. The majority (75%) indicated a need for improved features such as better lighting and more reliable controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Expert Consultation:</strong> Consultations with 5 occupational therapists and engineers specializing in adaptive technology confirmed that robust suspension and easy-to-use controls are critical for the safety and enjoyment of children with mobility impairments. Recommendations included the integration of high-torque motors and adjustable suspension systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototype Testing:</strong> Testing of 3 preliminary prototypes showed that 100% of users reported significant improvements in maneuverability and comfort with enhanced suspension and lighting features. Feedback from these tests further emphasized the necessity for customizable control options to cater to individual needs.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>These data-driven insights validate the need for a custom-designed vehicle that addresses the specific requirements of children with challenges similar to Jorge's. The project aims to bridge the gap left by existing solutions, providing a more suitable and effective option for improving mobility and quality of life.</p>
