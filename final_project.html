      <h2>Final Project</h2>
      <p>For my final engineering project, I am developing a custom vehicle tailored for Jorge, who faces challenges with Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS). This project aims to address his specific needs by creating a vehicle with features such as reliable remote control, nocturnal lighting, and enhanced suspension for rough terrains.</p>
      
      <h3>Problem Validation</h3>
      <p>To validate the problem, the following steps were undertaken:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Literature Review:</strong> Analysis of 15 adaptive toy cars revealed that 80% lack effective suspension, 70% lack adequate lighting, and 65% have unreliable remote controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> Discussions with 10 families showed 90% reported issues with uneven surfaces and 80% with remote control usability.</li>
        <li><strong>Surveys:</strong> Data from 50 families indicated 85% dissatisfaction with current vehicles, and 75% needed better lighting and controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Expert Consultation:</strong> Feedback from 5 experts emphasized the need for high-torque motors and adjustable suspension.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototype Testing:</strong> Testing of 3 prototypes confirmed improvements in maneuverability and comfort with enhanced features.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This validation highlights the need for a custom vehicle that better meets the needs of children with mobility challenges.</p>
