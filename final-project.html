            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The final project will focus on creating a device to measure the amount of pressure on the wrist while writing and provide a way to prevent excessive pressure. Studies have shown that 30% of frequent writers, including students and professionals, report experiencing wrist discomfort or strain due to excessive pressure during extended handwriting sessions. This issue has been documented over the past decade and affects a significant number of individuals in academic and professional environments.</p>
            
            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p>The problem statement is supported by data from various studies on repetitive strain injuries related to writing. Research conducted by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5675084/" target="_blank">National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)</a> indicates that prolonged handwriting can lead to musculoskeletal discomfort, particularly in the wrist and hand. Additionally, a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1757913920951744" target="_blank">study published in the Journal of Hand Therapy</a> highlights that 30% of individuals engaged in frequent handwriting report symptoms of discomfort and strain. This data underscores the prevalence of the issue and the need for effective solutions to address it, aligning with the problem statement and guiding the project's focus on mitigating wrist pressure and discomfort.</p>
